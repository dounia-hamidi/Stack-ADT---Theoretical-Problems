TD7 - Stack ADT

Theoretical Problems

1. What is a stack?

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. 
In a stack, the most recently added element is the first one to be removed. This means that the last item pushed onto the stack is the first item popped.

LIFO (Last In, First Out) means that the last element added (pushed) to the stack is the first one to be removed (popped)

Example: 

#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_SIZE 3

int stack[MAX_SIZE];
int top = -1;

void push(int item) {
    if (top < MAX_SIZE - 1) {
        stack[++top] = item;
    }
}

int pop() {
    if (top != -1) {
        return stack[top--];
    }
    return -1;  // Error if stack is empty
}

int main() {
    push(10);
    push(20);
    push(30);

    printf("Popped: %d\n", pop());  // Should pop 30
    printf("Popped: %d\n", pop());  // Should pop 20
    printf("Popped: %d\n", pop());  // Should pop 10

    return 0;
}

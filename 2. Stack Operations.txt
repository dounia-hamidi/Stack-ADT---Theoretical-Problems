1)Push(item): Adds an item to the top of the stack.

=>Time complexity: O(1) (constant time) – It involves only incrementing the top pointer and adding the item.

2)Pop(): Removes and returns the top item from the stack.

=>Time complexity: O(1) – It involves removing the item at the top and decrementing the pointer.

3)Peek(): Returns the top item without removing it.

=>Time complexity: O(1) – It simply accesses the item at the top without modifying the stack.

4)is_empty(): Checks if the stack is empty.

=>Time complexity: O(1) – It only checks if top == -1 to determine if the stack is empty.

5)is_full(): Checks if the stack is full.

=>Time complexity: O(1) – It compares top with the maximum size to determine if the stack is full.

6)clear(): Clears the stack by resetting the top pointer to -1.

=>Time complexity: O(1) – It only involves resetting a pointer, not modifying the stack's contents.

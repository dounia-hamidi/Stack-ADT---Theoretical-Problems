Algorithm to Convert Infix to Postfix Expression

1\- Steps to Convert Infix to Postfix Using a Stack
1)Initialize:

- Create an empty stack for operators.
- Create an empty list for the postfix expression (output).

2)Process Each Symbol: Iterate through the infix expression, and for each symbol:

* Operand:
- Append operands (e.g., A, B, C) directly to the postfix output.
* Operator:
While the stack is not empty and the operator at the top of the stack has greater or equal precedence than the current operator:
- Pop the operator from the stack and append it to the output.
- Push the current operator onto the stack.
* Left Parenthesis (:
- Push it onto the stack to signify the start of a sub-expression.
* Right Parenthesis ):
- Pop operators from the stack and append them to the output until a left parenthesis ( is encountered.
- Discard the left parenthesis.

3)Pop Remaining Operators:

After processing all symbols in the infix expression, pop any remaining operators in the stack and append them to the output.

2\-Reasoning Behind the Steps:

1)Using a Stack: The stack helps manage operator precedence and parentheses efficiently. Operators with higher precedence are processed first.
2)Precedence and Associativity: Operators like * and / have higher precedence than + and -. Left-to-right associativity ensures correct order in the postfix output.

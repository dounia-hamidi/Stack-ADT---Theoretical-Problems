1\- Algorithm to Check Balanced Parentheses Using a Stack:

1)Initialize:

- Create an empty stack.

2)Traverse the Expression:

For each character in the expression:
* Opening Parenthesis (:
     - Push it onto the stack.
* Closing Parenthesis ):
     - If the stack is empty (no matching opening parenthesis), the parentheses are unbalanced.
     - Otherwise, pop the top of the stack (it should be a matching ().
     - Ignore all other characters (e.g., operands or operators).

3)Final Check:

After processing the entire expression:
 - If the stack is empty, the parentheses are balanced.
 - If the stack is not empty, there are unmatched opening parentheses, so the expression is unbalanced.

Example:

Input Expression: (A + B) * (C / D)
1)Initialize:
Stack: []
2)Traverse the Expression:
 - (: Push to stack.
Stack: [(]
 - A: Ignore.
Stack: [(]
 - +: Ignore.
Stack: [(]
 - B: Ignore.
Stack: [(]
 - ): Pop from stack.
Stack: []
 - *: Ignore.
Stack: []
 - (: Push to stack.
Stack: [(]
 - C: Ignore.
Stack: [(]
 - /: Ignore.
Stack: [(]
 - D: Ignore.
Stack: [(]
 - ): Pop from stack.
Stack: []

3)Final Check:
Stack: [] (Empty, so the expression is balanced).
                                                                                                        Output: Balanced

2\- What Does It Mean for Parentheses to Be Balanced?
Parentheses in an expression are considered balanced if:

 - Every opening parenthesis ( has a corresponding closing parenthesis ).
 - Parentheses are correctly nested, meaning no closing parenthesis appears before its corresponding opening parenthesis.

For example:

Balanced: (A + B) * (C / D)
Not Balanced: ((A + B) (unmatched opening (), or (A + B)) (unmatched closing )), or )(A + B) (closing comes before opening).

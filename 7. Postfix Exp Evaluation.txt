Algorithm to Evaluate a Postfix Expression

1)Initialize:
 - Create an empty stack.

2)Process Each Token:
For each token in the postfix expression (read from left to right):
 * Operand: 
      - Push it onto the stack.
 * Operator:
      - Pop the top two elements from the stack.
      - Apply the operator to these two operands (the second popped element is the left operand, and the first popped is the right operand).
      - Push the result back onto the stack.

3)Final Result:
After processing all tokens, the final result will be the only value left in the stack.

Example:

Postfix Expression: 3 4 + 2 * 7 /
1)Initialize:
Stack: []
2)Process Each Token:
  - 3: Push onto the stack.
Stack: [3]
  - 4: Push onto the stack.
Stack: [3, 4]
  - +: Pop 4 and 3, compute 3 + 4 = 7, push the result onto the stack.
Stack: [7]
  - 2: Push onto the stack.
Stack: [7, 2]
  - *: Pop 2 and 7, compute 7 * 2 = 14, push the result onto the stack.
Stack: [14]
  - 7: Push onto the stack.
Stack: [14, 7]
  - /: Pop 7 and 14, compute 14 / 7 = 2, push the result onto the stack.
Stack: [2]

3)Final Result:
  - The stack contains a single value: [2].
  - Result: 2
